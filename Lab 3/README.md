# Lab 3:

Loading video, applying grayscale and sobel filter to every frame of the video and then displaying video with frames per second visible in the terminal to monitor speed of program. Grayscale and Sobel filter are implemented manually, without OpenCV's built in grayscale and sobel filter functions. OpenCV is only used for Mat data type and viewing images. The linux enviroment and files are then loaded onto the raspberry pi 3 B+ for a standard baseline test. <- in progress

FPS for 960 x 540 video on local machine: ~ 6.3 fps
