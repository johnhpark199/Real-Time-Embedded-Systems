# Lab 3:

Loading video, applying grayscale and sobel filter to every frame of the video and then displaying video with frames per second visible in the terminal to monitor speed of program. Grayscale and Sobel filter are implemented manually, without OpenCV's built in grayscale and sobel filter functions. OpenCV is only used for Mat data type and viewing images.

FPS for 960 x 540 video: ~ 6.3 fps

valve_sobel.PNG is image used to test functionality of sobel filter.
