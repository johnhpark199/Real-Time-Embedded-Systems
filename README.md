# Real-Time-Embedded-Systems

Real time embedded systems labs and final project, all completed with a raspberry pi 3 B+. C++ Code is written using vscode in a linux enviroment by mounting ubuntu on the VScode terminal using WSL. C++ code is then assmebled to a make file which is run using the gcc compiler. Projects primarily deal with applying a grayscale and sobel filter on a selected video file with the assistance of OpenCV. The later projects will optimize code using multi-threading and other techniques to approach true real time system operation.

Lab 2: Gcc compiler and linux based operation

Lab 3: Grayscale and sobel filter on raspberry pi 3 B+

Lab 4: Multithreading for optimization of grayscale and sobel filter on raspberry pi
